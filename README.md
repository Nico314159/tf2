## ðŸš§ #FixTF2 ðŸš§

As of the start of 2025, the original Team Fortress 2 has now been free of cheater bots for over 6 months, thanks to Valve bans. Heck, we even got [the missing final comic](https://www.teamfortress.com/tf07_thedayshavewornaway/) and a balance change, technically. The efforts by Valve are greatly appreciated â€” now here's to hoping it continues! *(subtext: Valve pls just unmute free-to-play users)* 

In any case, I will keep up my tireless work on making as faithful a recreation as possible, no matter the state of the source material.

## tf2
I have been working on recreating tf2 in Minecraft for the past 4 years, so I thought I would go ahead and share my work so far. Please be aware that this is insanely rough and unoptimized.
