# ðŸš§ #FixTF2 ðŸš§
While I've poured countless hours of my life into this project to be as faithful a recreation as possible, Valve has not been even *remotely* doing their job on the original game of Team Fortress 2. For the past 4 to 5 years, they've sat idly by as the game became increasingly plagued with hackers and aimbots. To make matter worse, these malicious users have not only been cheating in-game, but [committing **real world crimes** too](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNxjTciIwig). If you are seeing this message and care even a little bit about TF2, the rule of law, justice, or accountability, I highly suggest:

- A: If you play TF2 yourself, **boycott all in-game microtransactions**. Try to even boycott microtransactions in Valve's other IPs too (if possible).
- B: Voice your complaints in a negative review [on the steam page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/440/Team_Fortress_2/). A lot of people have been doing this so far and it's helped to bringing news media attention to the cause.
- C: Whether you play TF2 or not, please sign [this petition](https://save.tf/) **by July 1st** (not just some change.org thing; a physical paper copy listing all signatories will be shipped directly to Valve in August)
- D: Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Gj4RY8V6M) and/or read [this document](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1goBP5DVr0we85Ohnc7IHukOtTS-uISEa/view) for more specific information. 

UPDATE: Valve has recently banned over 16,000 cheater accounts. This is a good start for sure, but still a long ways off from a proper solution to the problem, so let's keep up our demands and the boycott, *especially* since the developers still aren't giving any channels of communication.

The goal is to raise awareness of these grievances and try to put pressure on Valve's reputation so they will #FixTF2!

## tf2
I have been working on recreating tf2 in Minecraft for the past 4 years, so I thought I would go ahead and share my work so far. Please be aware that this is insanely rough and unoptimized.
